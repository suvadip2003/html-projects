<p>Notes</p>
To make chocolate chip cookies, you need ingredients like butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and chocolate chips. First, cream the butter and sugars, then mix in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the dry ingredients separately, then gradually add them to the wet mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips, scoop the dough onto a baking sheet, and bake at 350°F for 10-12 minutes. Let them cool and enjoy your cookies!
